            multirole fighter aircraft originally developed by General 
            Dynamics for the United States Air Force (USAF). Designed as
             an air superiority day fighter, it evolved into a successful
              all-weather multirole aircraft. Over 4,600 aircraft have been
               built since production was approved in 1976.[4] Although no
                longer being purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions
                 are being built for export customers.[5] In 1993, General Dynamics 
                 sold its aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation
                 ,[6] which in turn became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger
                  with Martin Marietta.[7]</P>
